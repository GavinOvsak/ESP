# ESP
An app built to speak to you through a wired or bluetooth headset. Speaks SMS, Inbox, FB messages, twitter feeds, time every 30min, and can replay mast messages with bluetooth voice control button press

To use this app, I would recommend downloading the Notification Listener Settings app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.uk.thewirelessguy.notificationlistenersettings) in order to give this app permission to receive info about new system notifications.
